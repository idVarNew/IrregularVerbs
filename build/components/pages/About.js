     Hi, My name is Ewelina, the author of this app. There are two options why you are here now. If you want to learn irregular verbs, 
     I have a bad news for you, because this app was created only to show my React/Redux skills, hovever feel free to use it.
     If you are here to check how this app works, I hope it works as it should and you like it :)
    </div>
